# MunroLib

Generates a mutable list of Munro's in Scotland using CSVReader.readCsv()

Filter results using the extension function filterMunro with the options to sort by Alphabetical order or height (Ascending and Descending), min/max height and hill category(MUN/TOP)

CSV of munros can be provided using CSVReader.readCSV(file) or using the libraries pre-compiled list. The libraries own list is being handled as a String rather than a file because I could not get an Android Studio Kotlin only library project to read from a local file =(
